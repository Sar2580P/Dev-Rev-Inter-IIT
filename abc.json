        "Thought: To list all high severity tickets from a specific customer coming in from Slack, I need to identify the customer's user_id first. The customer's name \"Cust123\" is mentioned, so I will use the search_object_by_name tool to find the customer's user_id.\n\nAction: search_object_by_name\n\nAction Input: Search for the user_id of the customer named \"Cust123\".\n",
        "Thought: Now that I have the user_id of the customer, I can use the works_list tool to filter and list all high severity tickets coming in from Slack for this specific customer.\n\nAction: works_list\n\nAction Input: Use the works_list tool to filter work items with the following criteria: 'ticket.severity' should be 'high', 'ticket.source_channel' should be 'slack', and 'owned_by' should be the user_id obtained from the previous step ($$PREV[0]).\n",
        "Thought: With the list of high severity tickets from Slack for the customer obtained, I need to generate a summary of these tickets. The summarize_objects tool is designed for summarizing purposes and is the appropriate choice for this task.\n\nAction: summarize_objects\n\nAction Input: Summarize the list of high severity tickets from Slack for the customer Cust123 using the output from the previous step ($$PREV[1]).\n",
        "Thought: I now know the final answer.\nFinal Answer: The summary of all high severity tickets coming in from Slack for customer Cust123 is: $$PREV[2]."
