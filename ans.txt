    - It needs a list of objects as input and returns a summary of the objects. 
    



Before proceeding further, below I have mentioned common mistakes made by you while using the tools.

- MISTAKE_HIGHLIGHT : The tool "search_object_by_name" should not be missed as it can efficiently retrieve the ID of "Nu Ventures" project and prioritize related issues, using its high confidence matching feature.
- MISTAKE_HIGHLIGHT : The user wants to summarize and prioritize tasks, summarize_objects can help. It returns a summary of objects, perfect for task prioritization.
- MISTAKE_HIGHLIGHT : The agent should use the tool "who_am_i" as it helps identify the user_id when personal pronouns are used, enabling other tools like works_list to provide accurate results.


!! PLEASE GO THROUGH THEM CAREFULLY AND AVOID MAKING SIMILAR MISTAKES.




ALERT !!!
  - The Thought-Action-Observation repeats until we feel that agent has completely answered the user query.
  - Each time this process repeates, you need to write some reason in Thought of choosing a particular tool.

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer

Thought : The reason of picking the tool in process of answering user query.

Action : the Tool to take , should be one of [get_similar_work_items, works_list, summarize_objects]

Action Input: the input to the tool

prioritize_objects: 
    - Use this tool when asked to prioritize the objects. 
    



Before proceeding further, below I have mentioned common mistakes made by you while using the tools.

- MISTAKE_HIGHLIGHT : The tool 'get_sprint_id' should not be missed as it helps to retrieve the current sprint ID. 
It is useful when user query contains keywords like "sprint" and "ID".
- MISTAKE_HIGHLIGHT : "add_work_items_to_sprint" should be used as it adds work items to current sprint and matches user query's requirement.
- MISTAKE_HIGHLIGHT : The tool "add_work_items_to_sprint" should not be missed as it allows the agent to efficiently add all P2 issues related to "Zeta Initiative" to the current sprint, fulfilling the user's query. It simplifies the process by providing arguments for both sprint ID and work items, making it a crucial tool for managing sprints.


!! PLEASE GO THROUGH THEM CAREFULLY AND AVOID MAKING SIMILAR MISTAKES.

- MISTAKE_HIGHLIGHT : The tool works_list should not be missed as it can filter low severity tickets for the Xi Project and add them to the current sprint.
- MISTAKE_HIGHLIGHT : The agent should use the tool "who_am_i" as it helps identify the user_id when personal pronouns are used, enabling other tools like works_list to provide accurate results.
- MISTAKE_HIGHLIGHT : The tool "who_am_i" should not be missed as it helps to identify the user_id of the person being referred in the query with personal pronouns. This is crucial for other tools like works_list to provide accurate results.

prioritize_objects: 
    - Use this tool when asked to prioritize the objects. 
    



Before proceeding further, below I have mentioned common mistakes made by you while using the tools.

- MISTAKE_HIGHLIGHT : The agent should use the summarize_objects tool to provide a concise summary of high severity tickets in the "Deployment" stage assigned to User321. This will help the user to quickly understand the current status of the tickets and take necessary action.
- MISTAKE_HIGHLIGHT : The agent should use summarize_objects to provide a quick summary of the user's tickets in 'Review' stage for 'Cloud Services' part. This tool is useful for summarizing purposes and can handle lists of objects, which is exactly what the user needs.
- MISTAKE_HIGHLIGHT : The tool 'summarize_objects' should not be missed as it can provide a concise overview of tasks in 'Software Deployment' part and 'Release' stage.


!! PLEASE GO THROUGH THEM CAREFULLY AND AVOID MAKING SIMILAR MISTAKES.




ALERT !!!
  - The Thought-Action-Observation repeats until we feel that agent has completely answered the user query.
  - Each time this process repeates, you need to write some reason in Thought of choosing a particular tool.

Use the following format:

ALERT !!!
  - The Thought-Action-Observation repeats until we feel that agent has completely answered the user query.
  - Each time this process repeates, you need to write some reason in Thought of choosing a particular tool.

Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer

Thought : The reason of picking the tool in process of answering user query.

Action : the Tool to take , should be one of [get_similar_work_items, works_list, summarize_objects, create_actionable_tasks_from_text, prioritize_objects]

Action Input: the input to the tool

Observation : the result of the Tool
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
